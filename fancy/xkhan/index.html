Justin was going to get his heartbeat miked and we would have
been a punk rock band based on the heartbeat. We would have our
first concert at a Veteran's hospital on Veterans Day.<br><br>
Songs included "Mother of All Battles" and "It's Never Too Late
To Riot."<br><br>
We would have video projections and subject audience members to
..nevermind.. It may still happen. <br><br>
We would also have a bunch of touring cheerleaders. Dieu would have
been one of our cheerleaders. She just really wanted to wear a 
costume.<br><br>
T-shirt design. Of course. An image of Genghis Khan and the unholy
Mongolian horde descending upon the United States.<br><br>
