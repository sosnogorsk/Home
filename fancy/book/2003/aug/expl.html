This book is a reaction towards this perfect freeway that was built in 
Georgia. This freeway was going to last forever. On opening day, plants 
had already started to grow and began to crack the concrete.<br><br>
I dreamed of plants taking revenge on motorists. As I drive to and from 
work, a plant in its anger picks me up and puts me in a tree.<br><br>
I got really lazy and decided to collect pictures driving up and down teh 
101 and sketch them.
