I saw this amazing book at a Fluxus show for Dick Higgins at Otis Art 
School. It was an amazing book called <i>256 Little Clouds</i> by Dieter 
Roth. In the book, Roth put these scraps of paper onto a sheet of paper 
and photographed the page in raking light. This created a shadow that made 
you want to pick up the sheet of paper (or cloud). This is my attempt to 
recreate that feeling of want to touch a page. </div> </body> </html>
