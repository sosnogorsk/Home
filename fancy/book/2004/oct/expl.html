I was waiting in line for a few hours talking crap 
and complaining about life and how we live it. Somehow
the topic of lines and mobs came up. Would you rather
push someone to get somewhere or would you rather wait
patiently in an organized fashion?<br><br>
This book was originally called LINES/mobs but I got
fascinated by string that I began exploring the shape
of lines instead.<br><br>
