John Barth in <i>Lost in the Funhouse</i> has this little sentence printed 
on the side of the page. According to the directions, the reader needs to 
cut out the sentence and tape it together so that the story repeats itself 
and never ends.<br><br>
We took this idea and decided to make a book that can be read in more than 
one way. </div> </body> </html>
