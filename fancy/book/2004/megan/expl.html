I have been obsessed with food books for a while. I will speak briefly
about two books in particular--<i>Win Her With Dinner</i> and <i>The
Futurist Cookbook</i>. I simply adore <i>The Futurist Cookbook</i>. I
hate the other book. This book is simply a play on concepts from both
books. It's the realization that food is a very visual object and that
food really does set the mood. <br><br>
This book was done in collaboration with Megan Purn. She thought up of
the idea to write a book of how to make food for your enemies. Not
necessarily food to poison them, but food to confuse your enemies. The
quotes are from <i>The Art of War</i>.
