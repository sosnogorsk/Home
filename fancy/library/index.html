<b>Huntington<br>
Kater Krafts in Pico River<br>
Special Collections @ UCLA<br>
Occidental<br><br></b>

<b>Clark Library - Ninja Press<br></b>
Saw amazing books and amazing space.
Looks very East Coast old money except
done California style.<br><br>
Worth noting that Ward Ritchie studied
with F.L. Schmied, an amazing letterpress
printer. Schmied would print these
woodcuts with 30 print runs. Imagine 
trying to line up 30 plates and wait
for the ink to dry. Schmied worked
during the 1920s and the Clark has a
number of his books.<br><br>
Ninja Press books show a level of 
letterpress printing and graphic
design that I wish I had. I wish I
had the time to learn to typeset
properly.

<b>Special Collections @ LAPL<br></b>
Not much to report. The collection that is
left out in the Rare Book room isn't anything
special. A few choice items of California
printing history and first editions.<br><br>
<b>Cerritos Library<br></b>
Wow. If this library was not in Cerritos, I 
would work there. Amazing. Imagine how great
it would be if your boss had to work the worst
job in the entire library along with you. Yes,
at Cerritos, everyone has to work the welcome
desk just like Walmart.
