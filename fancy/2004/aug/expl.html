I have been getting angry at people flaking out on me. I thought
it was time for me to complain. I still love my friends. We'll see
if they'll love me back after this.<br><br>
I also got a screenprinting kit and wanted to see how rusty my
skills are. Yes, I am sensitive to my lack of skills. Wish I 
owned a Print Gocco.
