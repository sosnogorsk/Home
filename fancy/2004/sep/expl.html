I was getting incredibly lazy and wanted to do a project where I
had my friends do all the work. Some of the cards are spectacular.
Some are odd. Some are just plain weird. I love them all. Most of
the members of the book club do not get to see the entire set. I
am not ambitious enough to host the entire set online. Oh. I 
suppose I could. I'll have to ask.<br><br>

Also, I saw this amazing book called <i>Exquisite Horse</i> at the
Cerritos Library and wanted to do something like it. In that book,
this publisher contacted 30 letterpress printers to design a part
of the horse. The quality and the creativity is of a different 
level than my little project.
