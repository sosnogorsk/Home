I had this dinner party with a bunch of friends and wanted
to have people read racist jokes to each other. I also 
realized that I wanted a nice presentation. These birds are
called the hate-doves. I then, for December, got really lazy
and didn't want to design a new card and so I co-opted the hate
doves and made them peaceful.
