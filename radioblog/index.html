This is a radioblog. It is rather poppy
and I have much shame. It has no poppies
and I feel very lame. Very lame Vi.

I am not going to remove songs from here.
These are songs that get stuck in my head--
my version of top 40 radio.

Commmentary:
I've been challenged to come up with 15 new
worthy songs a month. So far, I have had it 
easy since it is a new enough project that I
could use songs that I've heard years ago. It
is getting tough. Make sure to listen to 
Santana V. - Totensamba.<br><br>
New challenge. Even harder. I don't listen to
very much folk music or bluegrass. Must find
something. It's pathetic that the best I can
find is Richard Thompson.
